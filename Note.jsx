      This was amazing and wonderfull Bootcamp on JavaScript and React.js conducted by the team of ShapeAI.
      The Bootcamp was for 7 days. In this Bootcamp our teacher Mr. Shaurya Sinha Sir teaches 
      us the basics of React and JavaScript on how to make our own website. I would Like to Thank ShapeAI for conducting
      such an amazing Bootcamp which really helped us all. And also i would like to thank Shaurya Sir as well for teaching 
      us and inspiring us. Also the best part about this Bootcamp was it was free of cost and anyone could learn this.

      Thank You!
